Hello, I'm Mat√©o Moglia. I am a PhD student in spatial econ at CREST/Institut Polytechnique de Paris,
I'm broadly interested in urban economics, local fiscal policies and local political economy.

This GitHub aims to gather any relevant code I'm likely to use through my research + share stuff about the classes I teach. 

Languages:

  * IT : Mostly Stata and R
  * Spoken : French (native), English (C1)
  
Any questions? Feel free to reach me on Twitter (@MateoMogliaEcon) or mail (mateo.moglia@gmail.com)
